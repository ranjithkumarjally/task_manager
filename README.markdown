# Task Manager Web App

A simple to-do list web application built with Python and Flask. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This is my beginner project to learn full-stack web development, and itâ€™s hosted online using Render.

## About the Project
This app lets you manage tasks easily. You can:
- Add tasks with a title, description, priority (Low, Medium, High), and deadline.
- Edit or delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as done or not done.
- View all tasks in a clean, mobile-friendly interface.

I built this to practice Python, web development, and deploying an app online.
